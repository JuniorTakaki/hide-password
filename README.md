# Password Toggle

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that includes a password input field with an eye icon. Users can toggle between hiding and revealing the entered password.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Enter a password in the password input field.

3. Click on the eye icon next to the password input field to toggle between hiding and revealing the password.

## How It Works

The JavaScript (`script.js`) file toggles the password visibility when the eye icon is clicked.
